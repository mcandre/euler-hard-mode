# euler-hard-mode - Project Euler problems done in HARD MODE

# HARD MODE

Solve each [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problem with a different programming language.

# REQUIREMENTS

* [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/)
* [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)

Vagrant abstracts away the many compilers / interpreters / bribes needed to setup each programming language. So you don't need to sully your computer with hundreds of software development tools (unless you want to).

# EXAMPLE

    $ cd problem1/
    $ vagrant up
    $ vagrant ssh

Then follow the directions in that problem's `README.md`.
